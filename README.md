# Data Analytics Project 3 - World Life Expectancy Regression Analysis   

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who  

Project can be seen in my [Jupyter Notebook file](https://github.com/SpringChhom/DA_Project3_Life_Expectancy_Regression_Analysis/blob/main/Spring_Chhom_DA_Project3_Life_Expectancy_Analysis_and_Regression_Model.ipynb)  

This dataset covers the years 2000 to 2015 and most of the world's countries. It contains the mean life expectancy for each country across the years and twenty measurable factors that are commonly found or expected to influence life expectancy.

For this project I decided to investigate which measurable factors have the most correlation with life expectancy with a focus on developed vs developing nations and how those factors may differ. I expect that adult, child and infant mortality rates will be correlated with life expectancy, along with vaccination variables. I also anticipate that development status of the countries will have a major impact on the life expectancy of their citizens.

I will use regression analysis in order to determine which independent variables in the dataset are the best predictors of the dependent variable life expectancy. Regression analysis is a reliable method of identifying which independent variables have the highest impact on a dependent variable.

The purpose of this project is for governments and NGOs to be able to make informed decisions regarding allocation of support and funding towards the aim of increasing life expectancy of citizens.

Conclusions are aimed at those working in world governments and NGOs.
Code is aimed at programmers or analysts with basic Python skills at least.

A note on the terminology of developed and developing countries. The World Health Organization and the World Bank have recently moved to using the terms low income, low middle income, high middle income and high income to categorize countries but since the dataset is based on the developed/developing categorization that was being used when the data was collected, I chose to leave it as is for the sake of simplicity and time. Regardless of the terms we choose to use, we cannot ignore the deep, long term effects of colonialism on a larger percent of the world.
